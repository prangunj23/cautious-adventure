<p>There are many issues being put up for debate on this coronavirus issue. Some experts believe that China is at fault for not alerting the world about the coronavirus fast enough and, not controlling the situation with the wet markets. Wet markets are markets were, "wet" goods are sold. Things like noodles, fruits, seafood, etc. In these wet markets, wild animals are eaten and consumed. One such example is the pangolin (pictured below) and bats. Some experts believed that the virus transmitted from pangolins first and then to bats.	</p>
